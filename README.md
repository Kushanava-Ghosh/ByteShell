# ByteShell---MASH
This is my attempt at creating a UNIX like shell in C language.

# How to Run
Go to the directory where you have downloaded this zip. In your terminal type ./shell and thats it

# Funtions implemented
1. myprint( implementation of printf):
  To be used in the file(eg main.c) can be used instead of printf
2. cd (change directory) :
  eg. cd /e/folder
3. help
4. ls
5. pwd (print working directory)
6. alias
  eg alias h help
7. show_aliases
8. unalias:
   eg unalias h
9. history
10. echo :
  eg echo hi
11. exit
